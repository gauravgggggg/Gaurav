This Data Structures Lab project includes five C programs demonstrating key concepts such as graph traversal, hashing techniques, and recursive algorithms. The first program implements a social network friend recommendation system using Breadth-First Search (BFS) to suggest mutual friends at two levels of connection. The second program stores student records in a hash table using linear probing for collision resolution. The third securely stores user IDs and passwords using double hashing to handle collisions. The fourth simulates a maze solver using Depth-First Search (DFS) with backtracking to determine if a path exists between two points in a grid. The fifth program manages student records in a hash table using separate chaining with linked lists to handle collisions. These implementations help reinforce practical understanding of adjacency lists, traversal algorithms, and various hashing methods in C programming.
